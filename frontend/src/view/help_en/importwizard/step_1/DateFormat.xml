	<content><![CDATA[Select the date format to be used for the export of your fields of the type "Date without time" and which you need for further processing. The date format is specified according to the JAVA SimpleDateFormat. For example, the following strings are available: yyyy (year, e.g. 1986), MM (month, e.g. 07), dd (day within a month, e.g. 10), HH (hour within a day, in this case always 00), mm (minute within an hour, in this case always 00), ss (second within a minute, in this case always 00). The format specification yyyy-MM-dd, HH:mm:ss could therefore stand for the following time specification 2021-01-10, 00:00:00.]]></content>
