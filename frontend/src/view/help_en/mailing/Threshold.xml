	<content><![CDATA[With the threshold value you define a safety limit with which you can prevent the mailing from being sent to too many recipients by mistake, e.g. because the target group used was subsequently changed.
If the threshold value is reached or exceeded, the mailing is automatically deactivated and must be manually released for sending again. The status mail recipient receives a notification when this occurs. However, the threshold value should also not be set too low so that your mail dispatch is not interrupted too frequently. Tip: Evaluate 5 samples and plan a buffer of a few percent on the largest sample.]]></content>
